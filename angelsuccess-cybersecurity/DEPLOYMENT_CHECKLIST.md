- [ ] `requirements.txt` contains all dependencies
- [ ] `Procfile` exists with correct web process
- [ ] `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11.0
- [ ] Database path is set to `/tmp/users.db` for Railway

### Local Testing
- [ ] Application runs locally: `python app.py`
- [ ] All routes work correctly:
  - [ ] `/` - Landing page
  - [ ] `/auth` - Authentication page
  - [ ] `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
  - [ ] `/network-monitor` - Network monitoring
  - [ ] `/ai-analysis` - AI analysis page
  - [ ] `/threat-intelligence` - Threat intelligence
  - [ ] `/optimization-center` - Optimization center
  - [ ] `/system-settings` - System settings
- [ ] Test user can login: `test@example.com` / `password123`
- [ ] Real-time data updates work
- [ ] Charts and graphs display properly

### Security
- [ ] Strong `SECRET_KEY` is set in environment variables
- [ ] Strong `JWT_SECRET` is set in environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in the code
- [ ] CORS is properly configured if needed

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

### Railway Setup
- [ ] GitHub repository is connected to Railway
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Railway dashboard:
  - `SECRET_KEY` = `your-very-secure-random-key-here`
  - `JWT_SECRET` = `your-jwt-secret-key-here`
- [ ] Automatic deployments are enabled (optional)
- [ ] Custom domain is configured (if needed)

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Application is accessible at Railway URL
- [ ] All static assets load correctly (CSS, JS, images)
- [ ] Database initializes successfully
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Session persistence works
- [ ] Real-time data updates function
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Charts load and update in real-time
- [ ] **Network Monitor**: Network data displays correctly
- [ ] **AI Analysis**: AI model metrics show properly
- [ ] **Threat Intelligence**: Threat feed updates
- [ ] **Optimization Center**: Optimization features work
- [ ] **System Settings**: Configuration pages load
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login/logout works seamlessly

## üêõ Troubleshooting Checklist

### Common Issues
- [ ] **Application won't start**: Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] **Database errors**: Verify database path is `/tmp/users.db`
- [ ] **Static files not loading**: Check template paths
- [ ] **Real-time updates not working**: Verify WebSocket/API endpoints
- [ ] **Authentication failing**: Check JWT secret and session config

### Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Real-time updates occur within 2-3 seconds
- [ ] Multiple tabs can be open simultaneously
- [ ] Memory usage is within limits

### Security Checks
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Session timeout works correctly
- [ ] API endpoints require authentication
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code

## üìä Monitoring Checklist

### Railway Dashboard
- [ ] Deployment status shows "Deployed"
- [ ] No recent deployment failures
- [ ] Resource usage is within limits
- [ ] Logs show no critical errors

### Application Health
- [ ] `/api/system-status` returns operational status
- [ ] Database connections are stable
- [ ] Background processes are running
- [ ] Error rate is low or zero

## üîÑ Maintenance Checklist

### Regular Checks
- [ ] Monitor Railway usage and limits
- [ ] Check for dependency updates
- [ ] Review application logs periodically
- [ ] Test all major features monthly
- [ ] Backup important data if needed

### Update Procedures
- [ ] Test updates in development first
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic periods
- [ ] Monitor closely after deployment
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready
